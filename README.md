# pyva
A compiler written in Python for a subset of Java language.

### Installation

Make sure to have:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >= [3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/)
    * [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) - can be installed with ```pip3 install pipenv```. If you have Python >= 3.4, pip is already installed. 
    Otherwise, [here's](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) a tutorial to install it.

### Setup

Create a pienv environment in your root folder with:
```pipenv shell```

Then, you can install the dependencies through:
```pipenv install```

Once finished, you can run or edit the project.
